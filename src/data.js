    company: "SAMSUNG",
    info:
     `Samsung's brand new Galaxy S7 is a subtle improvement over its predecessor on the outside, but a whole new beast on the inside. Powered by the Exynos 8890 SoC, this phone can blaze through absolutely anything you throw at it, with power to spare. The camera is absolutely amazing, especially in low light. This is a pragmatic phone, compared to its sibling the Galaxy S7 Edge, and is better value for money if you don't want to show off. However, with competition at an all-time high, you can also get most of its features and functions for one third this price.`,

    info:
    `The HTC Desire 626 Dual SIM is a 2015 phone that has been launched in 2016, and feels dated in the face of competition. It runs old hardware, old software and simply does not have any significant positives that make it worth buying. It costs far too much for what it is, and you're better off buying newer phones that come with better features and current software.`,
